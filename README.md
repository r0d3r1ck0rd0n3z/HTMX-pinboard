# HTMX pinboard


See demo here:

Use HTMX to create a minimal pseudo pinterest-clone. For my self-study only.


HTMX loads all text files saved in the `text` directory and displays them as an ideaboard (via CSS magic).


It's possible to add more functions via the GitHub API, but that requires generating a token.
